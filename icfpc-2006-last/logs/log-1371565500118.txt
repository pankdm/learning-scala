Chicago's Refuse and Recycling Program combines modern trash
classification with cybernetic labor to keep our city beautiful,
while at the same time minimizing waste and limiting consumer
spending. In keeping with our motto of "One Resident's Trash Is
Another Resident's Treasure," unwanted items are collected,
repaired, and redistributed to other residents who would have
purchased them anyway. Residents should contribute to the city's
program by leaving heaps of items unwanted on the sidewalk on
collection day.
