um.um
% This is a reference implementation of the Universal Machine.

The implementation supports all UM programs, including uncompressed
.um files and self-decompressing .umz files. To use this
implementation to run a UM binary called c.um, simply concatenate the
two files together:

cat um.um c.um > cmu.um

(Note: Not all versions of UMIX support the redirection operator >)

The resulting binary can be run in any compliant universal machine
implementation, including itself.

ZB> how's work?
GB> boring.  I'm working on a tedious date translation system
ZB> date translation?
GB> yeah.  you know that the CLV uses a different date system than we
    do, right?
ZB> yes, of course!  theirs goes back to before the Separating Disjunction!
GB> a lot of good that does us now.  we need to correlate their dates
    with ours so we can interpret the signal intercepts and figure out
    what they're planning to do next.
ZB> that doesn't sound hard.
GB> well, I have to account for the internal/external date distinction.
    our dates alpha-convert; theirs occur in a strict sequence.
ZB> interesting!  I didn't realize that anyone still used external
    dates.  
GB> and you've only been studying this kind of thing for a decade.
ZB> in a historical context!  what's their current system like?
GB> it's strange.  they seem to be counting *down* to something.
    near as I can tell, we're nearing the end of the year 1 in their
    system.
ZB> so the Separating Disjunction was 200 or so?
GB> near as I can tell.    
ZB> what's going to happen to their programs?
GB> their programs?
ZB> haven't you ever written some code that assumes that the year is a
    positive integer?
GB> hmmmm. that's a good point.
GB> want to get some dinner soon?
ZB> not just yet.  I'm close to finishing this translation I've been
    working on.  
GB> what are you translating?
ZB> a history from before the Separating Disjunction.  you know how hard
    it is to reason about heaps from then.
GB> fine, I can wait.

****URGENT SYSTEM MESSAGE> CODE LIMESTONE.****

ZB> you think this is a drill?
GB> probably.  we've been having so many lately.
ZB> it could be real.
GB> you don't think that the CLV has...?
ZB> I don't know.  I'll see you at the bunker in the north hills.
GB> okay.
ZB> see you.
