Betty:

Have you noticed how popular these "black-knot" toys are? Every store
I've been to while shopping for Holidays is sold out of them, and kids
are basically crying in the streets. Parents are in a panic.
Unfortunately the manufacturing process uses a technology called "Open
Terms," which is patented, so nobody can make competing replacements.

Well, I think I just figured out a way to build these toys using a
different process. Let me run this by you. First, here's a
mathematical formulation of what black-knots do:

  A black-knot has n inputs (numbered 0 to n-1) and n outputs.
  (These are the little holes that kids drop marbles into.) The
  black-knot is a function from each of its n inputs to a pair of
  integers (j, k) where 0 <= j < n and 0 <= k. The number j is the
  output hole that the marble comes out of. The number k is a number
  of "plink" sounds that are produced as the marble rolls unseen
  through the toy.

My manufacturing technique uses only two parts, or "combinators,"
called | and ><. I conjecture that we can reproduce each of the 11
models of the black-knot toy using only these combinators. With my
technique, a toy is just a grid filled with these two combinators.
(The | combinator has width 1 and >< has width 2.) Marbles are dropped
into the top of the grid, with input 0 being the first column, and
input n-1 being the final column. A marble that enters the top of a |
combinator continues into the row below in the same column. A marble
that enters the left side of a >< combinator emerges in the right
column and generates a "plink" sound. A marble that enters the right
side of the >< combinator emerges on the left but does not generate a
sound.

For example:

           012 
           ||| 
           ><| 
           |>< 
           ||| 
 
A marble that goes in column 0 comes out in column 2 with two "plinks". 
A marble that goes in column 1 comes out in column 0 with no "plinks". 
A marble that goes in column 2 comes out in column 1 with no "plinks". 


I expect children will be very picky about their knockoff toys being
observationally equivalent to the 11 official black-knot models. I've
written a simple program which you can use to access the mathematical
descriptions of these toys. Run the bk_specs file in your home
directory. The small ones are easy to reproduce but I'm having trouble
implementing the larger ones--can you help?
