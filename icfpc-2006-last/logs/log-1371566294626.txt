may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the
items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and
Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble
reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only
your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the
abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!. Interestingly,
