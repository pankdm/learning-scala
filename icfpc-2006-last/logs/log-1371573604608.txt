>: The note is written in a familiar hand. 
It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the
truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had
feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information
throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here,
but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece
may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the
items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and
Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble
reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only
your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the
abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!. Interestingly,
this one is self-addressed. 
Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: The downloader is (according to the label) fully compatible with
third generation municipal robots. 
Also, it is broken: it is a downloader missing a USB cable and a
display and a jumper shunt and a progress bar and a power cord.
