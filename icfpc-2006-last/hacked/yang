I. Introduction

Night and day. Beauty and truth. Oxygen and phlogiston.  Everywhere we
look there  are perfect opposites.  Balance is a  programming language
based  on  the  concept  of  harmoniously coexisting  duals.  In  this
language,  every operation has  an equal  and opposite  reaction. This
ensures  that  the machine  state  does  not  stray from  equilibrium.
Because it performs two  operations for each instruction, the language
is also twice as fast as single-operation languages.

Balance programs  are run inside  an 8-bit machine with  the following
features:
   * CODE: an arbitrarily long immutable stream of bytes
   * M[0..255]: 256 8-bit bytes of memory
   * IP: the instruction pointer (an arbitrary non-negative value)
   * IS: the instruction speed (ranging from -16 to +15)
   * sR[0..3]: four 8-bit source registers
   * dR[0..1]: two 8-bit destination registers
   * four instructions

Each instruction is specified by a single 8-bit byte. The bits
are numbered from most to least meaningful as follows:

           lmb
   .--------.
   |76543210|
   `--------'
  mmb

   * The bits 7,6,5 specify the opcode
and depending on the instruction:
   * bits 4,3,2,1,0 specify an immediate value IMM
or
   * bit 4 denotes a destination register D
   * bits 3,2 denote the first source register S1
   * bits 1,0 denote the second source register S2

Every problem in computer science can be solved by an additional layer
of  indirection. Balance  thus provides  this  facility automatically:
Each of the source and  destination registers is an indirect register.
For  instance,  most instructions  do  not  work  on the  contents  of
registers S1  and S2 directly,  but use the  contents of S1 and  S2 as
indices into the  memory M. The result is not stored  in D, but rather
stored in the memory location indicated by the current contents of D.

The  machine begins  with IP  = 0  and IS  = 1.  At each  step  of the
machine, an instruction is fetched from CODE[IP] (where CODE[0] is the
first  instruction,  CODE[1] the  second,  etc.).  The instruction  is
executed, and then IP is increased  (or decreased) by the value of IS,
modulo the length of CODE.*

* Note: For the sake of elegance, this calculation is performed modulo
  2^32, so that the instruction pointer computed is
       (((IS + IP) mod 2^32) mod length(CODE)).

II. Instruction Reference

The  four instructions  of  Balance  are  MATH,  LOGIC,  SCIENCE,  and 
PHYSICS.  The following  is  their  specification;  some  examples are  
given in a separate section below.


Opcode  (bits)   Description
 MATH    001
                 MATH  performs addition  and  its dual,  subtraction.
                 These act on different  registers so that the math is
                 not undone.  All operations are  modular with respect
                 to the number of  relevant bits. Source registers are
                 represented  with  two bits,  so  if  S1  is 3,  then
                 sR[S1+1]  is  sR[0].  Similarly,  dR[1+1]  is  dR[0].
                 Quantities in memory are eight bits, so 250 + 20 is
                 14.

                 M[ dR[D+1] ] <- M[ sR[S1+1] ]  -  M[ sR[S2+1] ]
                 M[ dR[D]   ] <- M[ sR[S1]   ]  +  M[ sR[S2]   ]

 LOGIC   010
                 LOGIC performs bitwise 'and' as well as its perfect
                 dual, bitwise 'exclusive or.'

                 M[ dR[D+1] ] <- M[ sR[S1+1] ]  XOR  M[ sR[S2+1] ]
                 M[ dR[D]   ] <- M[ sR[S1]   ]  AND  M[ sR[S2]   ]

 SCIENCE 000
                 SCIENCE tests  a hypothesis and  determines the speed
                 at  which the program  progresses. When  executed, it
                 sets the instruction speed IS to immediate value IMM,
                 as long  as the memory  cell indicated by  sR[0] does
                 not  contain  0.  Because  this  instruction  behaves
                 specially when  the memory  cell contains 0,  it also
                 behaves specially  if IS is set to  zero: the machine
                 then  halts. The  value IMM  is treated  as  a signed
                 five-bit number  in two's complement form,  so it can
                 take on values from -16 to +15.

                 if M[ sR[0] ] = 0 then (nothing)
                 otherwise IS <- IMM

                 if IS = 0 then HALT
                 else (nothing)

 PHYSICS 011
                 PHYSICS changes what the registers reference, in both
                 a linear  and angular  way. The immediate  value IMM,
                 treated as a signed  five-bit number, is added to the
                 register sR[0]  so that it may  reference a different
                 memory cell. The  instruction also rotates the values
                 between some subset of the registers, according  to a 
                 bitmask  derived from IMM.  The source register sR[0]
                 is always  part of  the rotated  set, so  the bitmask
                 used is a 6 bit  number where  the lowest 5  bits are
                 the same as IMM and the sixth bit is always 1.
                 
                 sR[0] <- sR[0] + (IMM as signed 5-bit number)
                 
                 let L=L0,...,L4 be the registers
                     dR[1], dR[0], sR[3], sR[2], sR[1]
                 then let C be the list of n elements Li
                     such that bit i is set in IMM
                     (bit 0 is the least significant,
                      bit 4 is the most significant)
                 then let Cs be the list (sR[0], C0, ..., C(n-1))
                 and  let Cd be the list (C0, ..., C(n-1), sR[0])
                 then, simultaneously
                      Cd0 <- Cs0
                      ...
                      Cdn <- Csn

Any other  opcode stands  for the instruction  BAIL, which  causes the
machine  to terminate  in failure.  Programmers sometimes  insert such
bugs  deliberately in  order to  quickly halt  the  interpreter during
testing.


III. Examples

If M[sR[0]] = 0, IP = 3, IS = 6, length(CODE) = 100,
and CODE[IP] = SCIENCE 12,
then in the next cycle IP = 9 and IS = 6.

If M[sR[0]] = 9, IP = 3, IS = 6, length(CODE) = 100,
and CODE[IP] = SCIENCE 12,
then in the next cycle IP = 15 and IS = 12.

If sR = {0, 1, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}, M = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...},
and CODE[IP] = MATH (0, 3, 1)
then in the next cycle M = {2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 253, 17, ...}.

If sR = {0, 1, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}, M = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...},
and CODE[IP] = LOGIC (0, 3, 1)
then in the next cycle M = {2, 3, 5, 7, 3, 7, 17, ...}.

If sR = {0, 1, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}
and CODE[IP] = PHYSICS -1
then sR[0] is updated with sR[0] + -1 = 255
and in the next cycle sR = {1, 2, 3, 4}, dR = {5, 255}.

If sR = {0, 1, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}
and CODE[IP] = PHYSICS -16
Then sR[0] is updated with sR[0] + (-16) = -16.
The bitmask for rotation is   1  1  0  0   0  0
       for the register set {-16, 1, 2, 3} {4, 5},
so in the next cycle sR = {1, -16, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}.

If sR = {0, 1, 2, 3}, dR = {4, 5}
and CODE[IP] = PHYSICS 15
then sR[0] is updated with sR[0] + 15 = 15.
The bitmask for rotation is   1  0  1  1   1  1
       for the register set {15, 1, 2, 3} {4, 5}
so in the next cycle sR = {2, 1, 3, 4}, dR = {5, 15}.


IV. Syntax

The Balance language concrete syntax is simply a single line of bytes,
each written  as two hexadecimal  digits, with no whitespace  or other
characters.


V. Balance Certified Professional Program (BCPP)

As  a professional  programmer, you  are invited  to join  one  of the
industry's    leading   programmer   certification    programs.   BCPP
certification  can be obtained  automatically by  solving a  series of
challenge  problems  and  verifying  the results  using  the  supplied
program "certify".

Industry standards demand 99.999% reliability to achieve high customer
satisfaction.  The  "certify"  program  tests that  solutions  to  the
challenge problems  fall within acceptable tolerance  levels. Since no
program can be  truly bug-free, the certification process  may need to
be run several times before the solution is accepted.

Please see  the file  PUZZLES for the  list of challenge  problems. To
certify  a solution,  stored  in  a file  called  "solve.bal", to  the
problem called "prop", run the command

   certify prop solve.bal

Because a  professional programmer knows  that shorter code  is better
code, your certified skill level  depends on the length of the program
that you submit to the certifier.

A challenge problem consists of  a description of the initial register
and  memory values  and  the desired  final  configuration. A  program
solves the challenge if it  achieves the final configuration and halts
gracefully (SCIENCE 0 with M[sR[0]] <> 0).

Accepted  applicants will  receive an  engraved sandstone  diploma and
will  be  added to  the  19101 electronic  edition  of  "Who's Who  in
Computerology." Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.
